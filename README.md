## 🚀 Features

- 📂 File selection with file dialog or drag & drop
- 🔒 Calculates SHA-256 and MD5 hash values
- ✅ Compares file hash with expected original hash
- 💻 Cross-platform Python GUI (Windows/Linux compatible)
- 📦 Distributed as a portable `.AppImage`
- 💡 Offline functionality

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Select a file using the file picker or drag and drop it into the app.
2. The application calculates the hash of the file (SHA-256 and MD5).
3. Paste the original hash value to compare.
4. The app notifies whether the file is intact or has been modified.
